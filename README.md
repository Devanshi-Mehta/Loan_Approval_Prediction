This was done through the following steps:
1. Understanding the data
2. Performing exploratory Data Analysis
3. Dealing with Missing Values and Outliers
4. Determining the accuracy of prediction by using various models namely: Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Random Forest, SVM and XGBoost.
5. Comparing the accuracy of all the models using KFold Classifier ( Logistic Regression has the highest accuracy(80.459%) )
6. Plotting the important features
